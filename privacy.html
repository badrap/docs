current technical and organizatorial privacy and security practices that
we know of. We use encryption in all data transfer and storage, access
control and auditing in all access to data, as well as backups and
version control to ensure the integrity and availability of databases and
user account data. We constantly ensure that all our employees are
aware of the importance of data privacy and that everyone works
according to best practices. Our employees are required to uphold
a non-disclosure policy for personal data according to the GDPR. When
a data breach happens, we are prepared to report the incident to the
supervisory authority as well as to the data subjects within the
required time limits specified by legislature. We are also prepared
to present our practices and measures to the supervisory authority, if needed.
We constantly strive to develop our practices and measures further
in order to improve the security and privacy of our service.</p> <p>Technically the process goes as follows: The user (you) registers
his/her/their email addresses and IP addresses to the service via a
TLS-encrypted session. The data provided by the user is stored into
a Google Cloud SQL database. The database is secured with strong
encryption and it implements SSAE 16, ISO 27001, PCI DSS v3.0 and HIPAA
requirements. Only named Badrap employees who maintain the service
can access the database. All email transmissions are done over
TLS-encrypted connections whenever possible. No physical copies are
ever made of users' personal data and no personal data is ever processed
manually.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/badrap/docs.badrap.io/edit/master/docs/privacy.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit this page on GitHub</a> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
