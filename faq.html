A really long time. We've
witnessed the benefits of exchanging security information, and the downsides
of blocking information flows. We know how hard it is for Internet users to
search for their own data from various services. We have friends and
family who roll their eyes about infosec news and wonder if they have vulnerable
devices in their own networks. We want to make exchanging security information
so easy and efficient, that both home users as well as enterprises can
search for their own data easily and find out if they are vulnerable.</p> <h2 id="is-there-any-danger-if-i-search-for-my-own-data-in-your-service"><a href="#is-there-any-danger-if-i-search-for-my-own-data-in-your-service" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Is there any danger if I search for my own data in your service?</h2> <p>Absolutely not. Information about your personal network assets (e.g. IP
addresses, email addresses) already exists out in the Internet. By searching
for your own data through our service, you just search for your own assets
from existing data sets published by security researchers. We could show the
results for your assets as soon as you enter our site, but we decided to put
the search functionality behind a button, so that we do not do anything
without your explicit consent, and that we can separate users who are really
interested in our service from random passers-by.</p> <h2 id="why-is-this-a-free-service"><a href="#why-is-this-a-free-service" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why is this a free service?</h2> <p>This is a pilot project, with one intention being to validate if people

well-qualified sources which we know really well. These same sources
are used by many other organizations who are interested in security and
vulnerability observations. We are also constantly looking to add more
good-quality sources for vulnerability information. Our current partners

We improve our service based on usage statistics, just like all other Internet
websites out there. Our difference is that we constantly try to think how we
could improve your privacy even more when using the service.</p> <p>A quick demonstration about this. We use Google Analytics to collect statistics about
our visitors, just like other web sites. Statistics are important to us, so that
we can improve the service. Here's how you can prevent us from collecting your visitor
analytics.</p> <p>You can block our analytics by using an adblocker extension in your web browser.
For instance, uBlock Origin is a good extension to use with Google Chrome. For
mobile devices you can use a privacy-oriented browser such as Ghostery or
Firefox Focus. Now that we told you this, please allow our site analytics in
the privacy tool of your choice and block everything else. 😃</p> <h2 id="if-i-create-an-account-will-you-send-me-spam"><a href="#if-i-create-an-account-will-you-send-me-spam" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> If I create an account, will you send me spam?</h2> <p>No way. If you want, you can request automatic notifications on any new
information regarding your IP addresses or email addresses. If any new
vulnerabilities appear, you will get a notification via email. We also
may inform you about major updates to the service as well as new features
that affect your use of the service substantially. You can always remove
any registered assets from your notifications as well as deny all email
notifications completely.</p> <h2 id="what-is-the-data-breach-monitoring-service-or-have-i-been-pwned-integration"><a href="#what-is-the-data-breach-monitoring-service-or-have-i-been-pwned-integration" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the data breach monitoring service (or &quot;Have I Been Pwned integration&quot;)?</h2> <p>We started off Badrap by allowing you to search for security information
relating to your important IP addresses. However, IP addresses are just one type
of important network asset. We have added email addresses as another asset type
that you can search for and get notified about. For this, we integrate with
security researcher Troy Hunt's data breach search engine Have I Been Pwned.
It allows you to search for information relating to your email address among
publically available data breach datasets. These data breaches may include
in addition to your email address other personal data such as passwords, home
address, telephone number, etc. In addition to IP addresses and email addresses,
we may add also other asset types in the future - let us know if you have some
good ideas!</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-data-breach-and-what-can-it-contain"><a href="#what-is-a-data-breach-and-what-can-it-contain" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a data breach and what can it contain?</h2> <p>A data breach usually contains personal data stolen or inadvertently made public
from a closed database. The most typical form of data breach happens when
you register for a service, the service contains some kind of security
vulnerability or is otherwise inadequately protected, and your personal data
is copied from the service database. Data breaches typically contain your
email address, any other personal data, passwords, and in really severe cases
even things like credit card details or bank account information. You can read
more about data breaches from our <a href="/types/databreach.html">instructions</a>.</p> <h2 id="how-does-the-have-i-been-pwned-search-feature-work"><a href="#how-does-the-have-i-been-pwned-search-feature-work" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> How does the Have I Been Pwned search feature work?</h2> <p>The Have I Been Pwned search feature works similarly to what we have been doing
with IP addresses. You register your email address into our service, so that we
believe you have a right to search for available security information relating to
it. We help you search for security information relating to your email address
from available good-quality sources. Initially we use security researcher Troy Hunt's
widely publicized and credible data breach reporting service Have I Been Pwned
to tell you about publically known security incidents relating to your email
address, such as data breaches.</p> <p>The Have I Been Pwned search feature works slightly differently in the sense
that when you enable the feature for your email address, we have to
submit your email address to the I Have Been Pwned search interface. That
service does not log any searches or store your email address when it is
searched. We explicitly ask for your consent and permission if you want to
enable the Have I Been Pwned search functionality. As with any other services,
if you do not trust Badrap or Have I Been Pwned to handle your email address
properly, you can simply choose not to enable the Have I Been Pwned search
feature.</p> <h2 id="finally"><a href="#finally" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Finally</h2> <p>We hope we were able to answer your questions above!</p> <p>You can always check the status of your current IP address with any web browser
without creating an account. However, by registering you can also search for
information regarding your email address and possibly other personal assets in
the future. By registering you can also get notifications regarding your registered
assets, which means you will automatically receive any new security warnings by
email. That way you can easily get up-to-date information on all of the different
IP addresses that you use daily at home, at work, or at the coffee shop, as well
