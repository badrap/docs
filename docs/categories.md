# About different categories of attacks

## Amplification attacks

Denial-of-service attacks are common incidents, where an attacker employs vulnerable machines in the Internet to send large amounts of malicious traffic to a victim organization, blocking the Internet connection of the victim and preventing the victim's services to work normally. An amplification attack is a form of denial-of-service attack, where the attacker uses an open Internet service somewhere to amplify the effects of the attack. Many innocent services found even in Internet users' home routers can act as an Internet megaphone, amplifying and making a small denial-of-service attack become a massive network outage.

To simplify, an attacker sends small data messages to your vulnerable device. Your device reacts to these messages by sending very large messages to the victim targeted by the attacker. The victim sees your IP address among possibly hundreds of thousands of other IP addresses as the source of the attack.

You can view a more technical explanation of this type of attack in this [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/xTKjHWkDwP0?t=1m2s). The example in this video shows an amplification attack happening via the common DNS service, but the principle remains the same no matter what vulnerable service is used.

This very common form of attacks can easily bring even a massive enterprise service to its knees. At the same time your Internet connection is likely blocked during the attack, and your Internet service provider can block your service temporarily to protect you and others from abuse.

Take care of your Internet connectivity, your reputation and future victims of amplification attacks. Block services that can be abused by criminals!

## Data breaches

Data breach is an incident where someone, usually inadvertently, exposes data
for bad guys to steal. A company holding our data may make their databases
available to the Internet by accident. Sometimes bad guys misuse vulnerabilities
to steal the company's data. Security researchers try to stay ahead and find the
data breaches before the bad guys do. They report their findings to get the
issues fixed and attempt to inform the victims via data breach monitoring
services.  The best case scenario is that the company fixes the problem before
the bad guys get their hands on it.

Sometimes your personal information leaks in the
breach.  We all provide data about ourselves when we register to online
services. Emails, home addresses, and so forth.  Also, some of the services
collect data about us automatically.
Governments have started creating regulation to
return the control to the user and penalise companies who don't act
responsibly with our personal information.  While those GDPR-banners may be
annoying, take comfort from the fact that privacy is coming back in style!

If your password has leaked, change it immediately. If you use the same or
similar passwords in other services,  change them too. Criminals know that
almost 30% of us use the same or similar passwords in other places, so they
use the leaked information to attack other services. If you use the same
password at work, change it also immediately. Talk with others what happened
to you and instruct everyone to use unique passwords. If you don't use a
password manager yet, start using one. Mac has software called "Keychain
Access". There are also third-party password managers, such as 1Password
and F-Secure Key.
