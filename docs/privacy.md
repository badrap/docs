## Purpose and legal basis for processing

Badrap processes the personal information of its registered users in order to
provide the service to the users. The legal basis for processing is explicit
consent of the data subject - your own consent. You can create an account to the
service yourself and submit your data if you choose to do so. We
always ask for explicit consent before any of your personal data is stored under
your user account.

For users who use our service without creating an user account, the legal
basis for processing personal data is our legitimate interests. We use
Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel to collect anonymous visitor statistics.
These technologies allow us to know someone visited our service.

## What personal information do we process?

- Your email address
- One or more IP addresses that you may choose to register into our service
- Security researchers' warnings regarding your registered IP addresses

## Data sources

We receive your personal data with your explicit consent when you
create an account for the service and when you use the service. You
can choose to register your current IP address under your user account.
If you register an IP address, it will be associated with your email
address (your user account). You can add more IP addresses under your
user account. Registering a new IP address under your account always
requires your explicit consent. You can at any time see all of your
personal data under your user account page, remove any registered IP
addresses from your account, or remove your whole user account completely.

We receive information security warnings from security researchers and
research groups who follow malicious Internet traffic. If an IP address
that you have registered is found in any security researchers' warning lists,
we will forward you any information regarding your IP address that we have
received from security researchers. Your personal data is never submitted to
security researchers or any other third parties - only you yourself have
access to your own personal data.

privacy as required by the GDPR, and that they are committed to

Your personal data is NOT used for automated individual decision-making or
profiling.

## Data protection principles and measures

Your personal data is stored and processed according to the best possible
current technical and organizatorial privacy and security practices that
we know of. We use encryption in all data transfer and storage, access
control and auditing in all access to data, as well as backups and
version control to ensure the integrity and availability of databases and
user account data. We constantly ensure that all our employees are
aware of the importance of data privacy and that everyone works
according to best practices. Our employees are required to uphold
a non-disclosure policy for personal data according to the GDPR. When
a data breach happens, we are prepared to report the incident to the
supervisory authority as well as to the data subjects within the
required time limits specified by legislature. We are also prepared
to present our practices and measures to the supervisory authority, if needed.
We constantly strive to develop our practices and measures further
in order to improve the security and privacy of our service.

Technically the process goes as follows: The user (you) registers
his/her/their email address and IP address to the service via a
TLS-encrypted session. The data provided by the user is stored into
a Google Cloud SQL database. The database is secured with strong
encryption and it implements SSAE 16, ISO 27001, PCI DSS v3.0 and HIPAA
requirements. Only named Badrap employees who maintain the service
can access the database. All email transmissions are done over
TLS-encrypted connections whenever possible. No physical copies are
ever made of users' personal data and no personal data is ever processed
manually.
