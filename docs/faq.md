# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why did you make this service?

We've worked a long time in information security. A really long time. We've
witnessed the benefits of exchanging security information, and the downsides
of blocking information flows. We know how hard it is for Internet users to
search for their own data from various services. We have friends and
family who roll their eyes about infosec news and wonder if they have vulnerable
devices in their own networks. We want to make exchanging security information
so easy and efficient, that both home users as well as enterprises can
search for their own data easily and find out if they are vulnerable.

## Is there any danger if I search for my own data in your service?

Absolutely not. Information about your IP address already exists out in the
Internet. By searching for your own data through our service, you just search for
your own IP address from existing data sets published by security researchers.
We could show the results for your IP address as soon as you enter our site,
but we decided to put the search functionality behind a button, so that
we do not do anything without your explicit consent, and that we can separate
users who are really interested in our service from random passers-by.

## Why is this a free service?

This is a pilot project, with one intention being to validate if people
are really interested in this kind of service. We've received some private
funding from [ScanABC](https://www.scanabc.com/) as well as some
public funding from [TEKES](https://www.businessfinland.fi). If
you like the service and think we're doing an important job, please use it
as much as you can and tell others about it. This helps us verify our ideas
and to prove that this kind of service is truly needed in today's world.

## Where do the security researchers' warnings come from?

We've started by requesting for data from a few extremely credible and
well-qualified sources which we know really well. These same sources
are used by many other organizations who are interested in security and
vulnerability observations. We are also constantly looking to add more
good-quality sources for vulnerability information. Our current partners
are:

- [Shadowserver](https://www.shadowserver.org/)
- [Fitsec](https://www.fitsec.com/)
- Telia

## Are you monitoring me or my networks?

Short answer: no.

You can find a longer answer in our [privacy policy](./privacy.md).
We improve our service based on usage statistics, just like all other Internet
websites out there. Our difference is that we constantly try to think how we
could improve your privacy even more when using the service.

A quick demonstration about this. We use Google Analytics to collect statistics about
our visitors, just like other web sites. Statistics are important to us, so that
we can improve the service. Here's how you can prevent us from collecting your visitor
analytics.

You can block our analytics by using an adblocker extension in your web browser.
For instance, uBlock Origin is a good extension to use with Google Chrome. For
mobile devices you can use a privacy-oriented browser such as Ghostery or
Firefox Focus. Now that we told you this, please allow our site analytics in
the privacy tool of your choice and block everything else. :)

## If I create an account, will you send me spam?

No way. If you want, you can request automatic notifications on any new
information regarding your IP addresses. If any new vulnerabilities appear,
you will get a notification via email. We also may inform you about major
updates to the service as well as new features that affect your use of the
service substantially. You can always remove any IP addresses from your
notifications as well as deny all email notifications completely.

## Finally

We hope we were able to answer your questions above!

You can always check your current IP address with any web browser without
creating an account. However, by registering you can subscribe to notifications
regarding your IP addresses, which means you will automatically receive any new
security warnings by email, and you can easily get up-to-date information on
all of the different IP addresses that you use daily at home, at work, at the
coffee shop, and so on.
