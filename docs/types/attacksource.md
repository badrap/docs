# Attack Source

## Problem description

This IP has been identified as a source of attacks. Usually this means that someone else is controlling your device and using it to attack others. Your device may be used to find new victims to infect, gain unauthorized access to to other devices, scan networks for vulnerabilities and try to exploit them, or cause disruption to normal Internet services.

These forms of attacks are detected automatically by researchers with devices called honeypots, which simply listen for attack attempts and record the attacker IP address and attack type when an attack is detected. Sometimes also the victims of these attack attempts alert researchers that they have seen an attack from a particular IP. 

Our research partner Deutsche Telekom Honeypot Project operates a network of honeypots around the world as part of their Cyber Early Warning System.

## Suggestions for repair

First of all you need to identify the device which is sending out these attacks. [Please read our instructions on locating vulnerable devices.](../locate.md)

After you find the correct device, we recommend you to reset it to its factory settings or perform a full reinstall of the operating system. If your device is compromised and sending out attacks, it is usually too complex to try to clean the system without a full reset. 

After you reset the device or reinstall the operating system, you should install all of the latest software updates to make sure your system will not be compromised in the same way again. If no security updates are available, you might consider switching to a different device, which is updated against known vulnerabilities.
